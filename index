<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Rachel Chen. For the past two years, I have been doing the most challenging and rewarding work, a full-time mother. Although I am still learning on the job and striving on being a better mother, I think it is time for me to get another challenge, which is to be a programmer.</p>
<p>My most recent full-time work outside home was analyzing data using SQL. I enjoyed the logical thinking and problem solving process. </p>

<h2>My work</h2>
<p>Here are: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>the link to my <a href = "https://freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a> page</li>
    <li>the link to my <a href = "https://www.codewars.com/users/Rachyanh">Codewars</a> page</li>
    <li>the link back to the GitHub repo</li>
    <li>to be continued...</li>
  </ul>
