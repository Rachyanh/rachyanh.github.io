        <img src="/image.jpeg" Alt="Rachel with her son">
        <p>Hi, my name is Rachel Chen. For the past few years, I have been doing the most challenging and rewarding work, a full-time mother. Although I am still learning on the job and striving to be a better mother in every aspect, I think it is time for me to get back to my career track. </p>
        <p>My most recent full-time work outside home was analyzing data using SQL. I really enjoyed the logical thinking and problem solving process. As a Healthcare Analyst, in addition to developing a variety of complex ad hoc reports and trend analyses using SQL and Excel, I was sometimes given projects, such as forecasting number of patients and revenue for a potential site of the company. These projects and experience have greatly sharpened my analytic and problem-solving skills. When my previous employer established a LLC to help other community clinics reach their electronic health record goal, I was added more responsibilities, which included all data support for the LLC. I have learned the importance of multitasking and prioritizing in the fast-paced working environment. It was a tough decision to quit the job I loved and move to the UK, where my husband pursued his master degree and career, especially when my manager told me about the promotion I would get in two months.  </p>
        <p>I am a fast learner and I have never stopped learning. I will show you how quickly I can adjust myself and pick up multiple data analytics tools, just like how I became data savvy from an accountant, who knew nothing about SQL. Please be in contact to schedule an interview at your convenience. Thank you for your time and consideration. </p>
