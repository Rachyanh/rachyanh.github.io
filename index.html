<p>Hi, my name is Rachel Chen. For the past two years, I have been doing the most challenging and rewarding work, a full-time mother. Although I am still learning on the job and striving on being a better mother, I think it is time for me to get another challenge, which is to be a programmer.</p>
<p>My most recent full-time work outside home was analyzing data using SQL. I enjoyed the logical thinking and problem solving process. </p>
