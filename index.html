        <p>Hi, my name is Rachel Chen. For the past two years, I have been doing the most challenging and rewarding work, a full-time mother. Although I am still learning on the job and striving to be a better mother in every aspect, I think it is time for me to get another challenge, which is to be a programmer. </p>
        <p>My most recent full-time work outside home was analyzing data using SQL. I really enjoyed the logical thinking and problem solving process. I was eager to learn more programming languages when I recently had some free time at home, and that was how I found Founders and Coders online in November 2018. I started to work on the prerequisites since then. It has been a great challenge for me to complete everything before the application deadline, because my son still needs a lot of my care and attention. </p>
        <p>I will try my best to complete more tasks on Codewars and freeCodeCamp in the future months regardless whether I will be lucky enough to be in the next cohort. It makes me feel good to learn a little more each day. Thank you for introducing me these great websites! </p>
